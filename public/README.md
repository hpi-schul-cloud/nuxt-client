# STATIC

This directory contains your static files. Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

But keep in mind, that there is no webpack processing involved. In most cases it is better to use the /assets directory. Especially for images you should use `/assets` because otherwise theming is currently not possible.
