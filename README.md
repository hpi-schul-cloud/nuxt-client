# Schulcloud-Verbund-Software - Frontend

## The Repository

This repository contains the (modern) frontend-code of the "Schuldcloud-Verbund-Software"-project and it is based on Vue.js and written in JavaScript and TypeScript.

There is also an old frontend for the project, that still handles part of frontend: schulcloud-client. (see links below)

## The "Schulcloud-Verbund-Software"

The "Schulcloud-Verbundsoftware" is an intuitive digital teaching and learning environment that can be used from any location, at any time and independent of the end device. It offers a protected space in which teachers and students can safely use digital teaching and learning content.

As a pedagogical collaboration tool, the Cloud combines the structured delivery of learning content and assignments to classes and courses (learning management) with a working and collaboration environment for teachers and learners in a common user interface.

With the seamlessly integrated learning store, the cloud offers access to a wide range of digital learning content. The offer ranges from simple worksheets to video explanations and learning programmes to multimedia-didactically prepared learning content.

The "Schulcloud-Verbundsoftware" is developed according to the one-for-all principle: All partners benefit from the joint further developments. Where necessary, the software is adapted to country-specific needs.
