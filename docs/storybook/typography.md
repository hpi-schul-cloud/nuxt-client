# Typography

Typography adjusts according to screen size as well as hard breakpoints related to the screens width.

All scaling is done with the following variables:

| variable | value | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--text-base-size` | `1rem` | base font size that everything depends on
| `--text-scale-ratio` | `1.2` | defined the scaling between the font size levels (h1 - h6)
| `--text-device-scale-ratio` | `1.125` | defined the scaling between device types

You can check out all variables [in our docs](https://vuepress.test.hpi-schul-cloud.org/2-Styles/0-Variables.html#typography).
