# DATA TABLES

- Currently, we have `DataTable` and `BackendDataTable` components. Their structures are very complicated and hard to maintain. We recommend refactoring the data tables with Vuetify components. So that we have clean, maintainable code. After changing, we also have a chance to remove all `base` components.
