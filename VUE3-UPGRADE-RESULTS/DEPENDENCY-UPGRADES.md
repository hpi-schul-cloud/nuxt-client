## Library Notes

### vue-i18n

```html
<template>
  <p>We can use the $t helper in templates: {{ $t('translation.key') }}</p>
</template>

<script setup>
  // we can use the official composable now.
  // no need for provide / inject anymore
  const { t } = useI18n();

  // translations have to be reactive!
  const translatedValue = computed(() => t("translation.key"));
</script>
```

### vue-dndrop

```sh
npm i vue-dndrop@next
```

_should be replaced by `vue-draggable` (based on sortable.js) because of re-rendering issues_

### Vue3-MQ

`$mq` has to be replaced by injection

### vue-filter-ui

- The `DataTable` component uses `vue-filter-ui` dependency which is not competible with vue-3. And seems there is no info or plan to upgrade the dependeny in its repository.
- **Recommended Solution-1:** Implement our own methods as the dependency does.
- **Recommended Solution-2:** Refactor `datatables` with vuetify components.
